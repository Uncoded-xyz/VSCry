# VSCry
A CLI utility to Obfuscate your VirgoScript code or Plugins. People will literally Cry when they'll see the Obfuscated code.
## Howto
./vscry.exe <nameofvirgofile> (without the .virgo)
### Token
  Please always store the given Token of the Encrypted file! It's the ONLY way you will be able to recover it.
## Why?
If you want to sell a Plugin, or a command, in our Shop...You might want to encrypt it first to prevent people from nulling it or copying it.
## Soon
We'll soon make a Web Interface at https://virgo.uncoded.xyz/vscry/
